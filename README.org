* NGINX HTTP SASL authentication module

This is experimental.

** Dependencies
If you want to build this, it expects an nginx source tree in '../nginx'

you also need https://github.com/arithy/packcc in '../packcc/'

you can test with this script:
https://github.com/stef/libopaque/blob/master/sasl/http_sasl.py if you
have also the opaque mechanism installed from the libopaque
repo. Otherwise adapt the script to use a different mechanism.

In any case the Makefile explains it all, or has pointers to more
information.
